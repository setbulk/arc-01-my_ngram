## My ngram

### Description
Imagine you are in 1990 and your printing supervisor asks you how many letters are used in words, what would you do? This is a project you may count characters?
The program takes one or more text arguments and calculates the frequency of each character in the input text. It then prints out the counts of each character along with the character itself.
### Task
In the My ngram project, the task was to check the number of times each letter and output it in alphabetical order

### Usage
- Compile the program using a C compiler:

```sh
gcc -o ngram ngram.c
```
- Run the program with one or more text arguments:
```sh
./ngram text [text2, text3...]
```
